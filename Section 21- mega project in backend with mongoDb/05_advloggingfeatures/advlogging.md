 A logger in an application is a tool or mechanism that helps you collect and store data about the application's behavior during runtime. This data typically includes:

Error Logs: Information about any errors or exceptions that occur.
Request Logs: In web applications, details about incoming HTTP requests (e.g., method, URL, status code, response time) to help you monitor and debug server interactions.
Event Logs: Records of specific actions or events that happen in the application (e.g., user login, database queries, API calls).
Debug Logs: Detailed, often verbose logs used for troubleshooting and understanding how the application works at a deeper level.
